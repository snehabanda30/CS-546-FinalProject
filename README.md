# Introduction:
A local community website where neighbors can request and offer help for tasks like grocery shopping, yard work, or technical assistance. Users can request specific types of help and other users can find people who can help them with their tasks.  

The purpose of this application is to provide the community with an online resource to find help for needed tasks like throwing out trash, planting flowers or carrying groceries. We believe this application can build community collectiveness, and help communities come together and collaborate.
