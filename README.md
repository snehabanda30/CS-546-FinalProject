# NeighborAid

CS-546 Final Project

## Introduction

A local community website where neighbors can request and offer help for tasks like grocery shopping, yard work, or technical assistance. Users can request specific types of help and other users can find people who can help them with their tasks.

The purpose of this application is to provide the community with an online resource to find help for needed tasks like throwing out trash, planting flowers or carrying groceries. We believe this application can build community collectiveness, and help communities come together and collaborate.

## Development

- First, clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/snehabanda30/CS-546-FinalProject.git`
- After cloning the repo, go to the project directory and open the terminal and type `npm install`
- For developing with handlebars and Tailwind, first make sure to run `npm run tailwind-generate` in a separate terminal
- Then, open a new terminal and run `npm run dev` to start a nodemon server to make your changes and have it auto refresh
  - If you do not have nodemon installed, you can install it globally by using `npm install -g nodemon`
